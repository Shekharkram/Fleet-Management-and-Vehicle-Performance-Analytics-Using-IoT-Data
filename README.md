# **Fleet Management and Vehicle Performance Analytics Using IoT Data**

## Overview  
This project involves the analysis of vehicle performance and fleet management data, utilizing IoT data from various vehicles. The dataset contains important metrics like vehicle health, fuel levels, engine temperatures, speed, and driving behavior. The primary aim of the project is to optimize fleet operations by analyzing and predicting vehicle performance, maintenance needs, and fault occurrences.

## Objective  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and patterns in vehicle and fleet data.
- Build **predictive models** for vehicle health monitoring to anticipate breakdowns or maintenance needs.
- Analyze **fault codes** to identify correlations between specific issues and vehicle characteristics.
- Provide insights to **optimize fleet management**, reduce operational costs, and increase fleet safety.

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project simulates real-world vehicle performance data and fleet management records, including:
- **Vehicle Performance Data**: Includes attributes like speed, fuel level, engine temperature, and fault codes.
- **Maintenance Records**: Contains details about vehicle servicing, including service dates and associated costs.
- **Fleet Data**: Details about fleets, such as fleet ID, company, and region.
- **Fault Codes**: A collection of fault codes and descriptions for vehicle issues.

## Technologies Used  
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing and managing the fleet and vehicle data.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For data exploration, visualization, and model evaluation.
- **SQL**: To query and manipulate the dataset in PostgreSQL.
